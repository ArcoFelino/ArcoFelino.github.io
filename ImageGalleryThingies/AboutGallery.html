      <h2>Behind the page</h2>
      <p>This was possible because of the support from a lot of friends which helped me learn coding by motivating me into doing so; the support of the different teachers that encouraged me to learn to create what I imagine; and from the feedback that they also provided. Learning is not a straight line, not a curve either, it's like a mountain range, there are difficulties and falls, but it's possible to stand up again and learn from the mistakes. It's also about the perseverance, the will to learn and to practice. If it weren't for all these people, I would not have watched all those videos of learning to code in Scratch, I would not have discovered a lot of free HarvardX courses and I wouldn't be where i'm standing right now. Thank you!</p>

            The Burglar and the Unexpected Protectors
        </h2>
        <p>
            It was a halloween night, I do remember that detail. A burglar broke into the apartment complex, we knew it because of the sound of something breaking and then some people shouting. It was scary for me because at the moment I was like 9 years old back then and I tought we could get robbed or something. At the same time I also wanted to see the burglar or whatever was causing such noises, but was told to stay in my bedroom.<br>
            I heard shouting in the hallway, the complex had a long hallway that traversed all the 3 'towers' (Which weren't really towers, as it was all connected) and there were small internal balconies, so you could hear what happened in the first floor hallway on the next tower while being on the fourth floor. Some people were screaming at the person who tried to break in an appartment, I later knew the police had already been called, but they hadn't arrived yet, so, instead of waiting, the residents used brooms, a bat and their fists to take down the burglar. My parents allowed me out of the apartment because they were also peeking to see what was happening, so I actually came to see the silhuette of the guy, but I couldn't get nearby to watch the scene with details.<br>
            They had beaten the burglar badly even before the security guard of our complex got there, he even had to push them aside because they could've killed him! Even after the guard separated them, they were still yelling curses and angry things at him like "<i>Maldito!</i>" which meant "Curse you!" and other inappropiate things. After that, the guard took the burglar to the main entrance and waited for the police to arrive. They took him and were surprised to find him beaten so badly.

            Final words from the writer

        <p>
            That was the whole of the story, although that's not all to it, we can also reflect on what it really yields:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried.

            Sometimes, <b>we are stronger</b> than what we think of ourselves, and this story proves it. We were capable of protecting our homes in this case, we stood up for ourselves and fought back the adversities, and others may be capable of similar achievements, but you'll never know if you don't <strong>try doing it</strong>.
